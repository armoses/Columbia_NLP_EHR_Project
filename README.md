# Columbia_NLP_EHR_Project
Final project for QMSS 5067: analyzing health records with NLP techniques

DONE:
- Explore data

TODO:
- Preprocess
    - remove stop words done (looks like there is no stop words...)
- Train models
    - Random forest
    - Bayesian methods
    - K-Means
    - Try Vidya's suggestion of grouping specialties/labels and doing a multi-level model (e.g., first surgery vs not-surgery, then narrow down further)
- Evaluate models
