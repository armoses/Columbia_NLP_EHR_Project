# Columbia_NLP_EHR_Project
Final project for QMSS 5067: analyzing health records with NLP techniques

DONE:
- Explore data
- Preprocess

TODO:
- PCA `done`
- Train models
    - Random forest `done`
    - Bayesian methods
    - K Nearest Neighbors `done`
    - Try Vidya's suggestion of grouping specialties/labels and doing a multi-level model (e.g., first surgery vs not-surgery, then narrow down further)
- Evaluate models

QUESTION:

- the model score looks a bit poor...? 
  - `rfc.score()` `knn.score()`
